## üõ°Ô∏è Web Application Security Skills

I have a solid, hands-on understanding of the most critical web application security risks as defined by the OWASP Top 10. My training on the TryHackMe platform has equipped me with practical skills in identifying and mitigating these vulnerabilities.

-   **A01: Broken Access Control:** Understanding and preventing unauthorized access to functionality and data.
-   **A02: Cryptographic Failures:** Protecting data in transit and at rest.
-   **A03: Injection:** Defending against SQL, NoSQL, and command injection attacks.
-   **A04: Insecure Design:** Recognizing risks related to fundamental design flaws.
-   **A05: Security Misconfiguration:** Hardening configurations for servers, frameworks, and applications.
-   **A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components:** Managing risks from third-party libraries and components.
-   **A07: Identification and Authentication Failures:** Securing user identity and session management.
-   **A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures:** Protecting against insecure deserialization and data tampering.
